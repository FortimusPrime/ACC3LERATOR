# VW 2.0 TSI Engine Mockup with LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Robotics

Welcome to the repository for the **VW 2.0 TSI-inspired engine mockup**, integrated with **LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Robotics**. This project combines the fundamental mechanical principles of a Volkswagen 2.0 TSI engine model with the programmability of EV3 robotics to create an interactive and educational experience.

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code that controls the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 with the API **PyBricks.py**, simulating the workings of a VW 2.0 TSI engine. If you're interested in a visual demonstration of the mockup in action, you can watch the full presentation on YouTube:
